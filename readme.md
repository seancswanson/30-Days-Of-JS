Welcome to the repository for my daily Javascript Challenges. I am following Wes Bos' 30-day JavaScript challenge and will store them here! 

I highly recommend checking out other thing's that Wes is doing in the world of web development. I would particularly implore a listen to his podcast, Syntax.fm, where he co-hosts with Scott Tolinsky of LevelUpTuts on topics all over the board but pertaining to web development.
